## ðŸ¤– Creating a Chatbot

The chatbot creation process consists of 4 steps. Let's go through each one:

### Step 1: Bot Identity & Theme

In this step, you'll configure your bot's basic identity:

#### **Bot Description** (Required)
- Enter a clear description of what your bot does
- Example: "Helps customers with common questions and support issues"
- This helps users understand your bot's purpose

#### **Domain** (Required)
- Enter your website domain where the bot will be deployed
- Example: `support.example.com` or `help.mystore.com`
- This is used for bot identification and deployment

#### **Theme Color**
- Click the color picker to select your bot's primary color
- This color will be used for the chat interface and bot avatar border
- Choose a color that matches your website's branding

#### **Avatar Selection**
- Choose from a variety of pre-designed avatars
- Each avatar has a unique personality and appearance
- Select one that best represents your brand or bot's purpose

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Choose an avatar that aligns with your brand personality and target audience.

### Step 2: Bot Personality & Behavior

This step defines how your bot will interact with users:

#### **Bot Personality**
- **Professional & Helpful**: Formal and business-like communication
- **Friendly & Casual**: Warm and approachable tone
- **Technical & Precise**: Detailed and accurate responses
- **Custom**: Define your own personality (Premium feature)

#### **System Prompt Templates**
Choose from pre-built templates or customize your own:

**Customer Care Assistant**
- Professional, polite, and empathetic

- Define your bot's role, tone, and focus areas
- Include specific instructions for handling different scenarios

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Be specific about your bot's limitations and when to escalate to human support.

### Step 3: Knowledge Base Integration

This is where you make your bot intelligent by uploading relevant documents:

#### **Supported File Types**

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Start with your most frequently asked questions and expand over time.

### Step 4: Preview & Create
